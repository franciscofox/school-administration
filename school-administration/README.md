## Descriotion
The School Administration web app is a tool designed for administrative tasks within educational institutions. This app simplifies the process of managing rooms and students within a school database. It provides functionality to add, delete, and view rooms and students, and importantly, it allows users to explore relationships between rooms and students, such as identifying siblings, listing the students in a particular room, and determining which rooms a student belongs to.
